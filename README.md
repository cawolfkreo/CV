# Personal Webpage
This is a personal webpage I made to describe a little about myself, what I do and how to contacte me.

## Motivation
This is a project for a webdevelopment class in [Uniandes](www.uniandes.edu.co). The objective is that everyone on the course has a presentation webpage like this one.

## Getting Started
There are two ways you can check the website. for the easiest one you only need a web browser, hopefully Mozilla fire fox or Chrome.

If you don't want to display the webpage in the easy way, then you can download the contents of this repo on a folder and install an http file server, I recomend two you can use now with npm:
* http-server:
  ```
  npm install -g http-server
  ```
* reload:
  ```
  npm install -g reload
  ```
Just run any of those commandsand install one of the servers, that should be enough for preparation.

## Deployment
Again, we have two ways of doing this:
* __The easy way:__ Go to your browser and type:
  ```
  cawolfkreo.github.io
  ```
  or just click [here](http:cawolfkreo.github.io)
* __The file server - way:__ Now that you have installed the http file server on your computer, go to the folder where you downloaded this repo and make it run there. Then just open ```localhost``` in your browser with the port number where the server is listening.
